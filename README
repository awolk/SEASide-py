Version Control
---------------
General Guidelines:
* Major changes should be done in branches
* Commit messages should be descriptive and written as actions:
  Ex: Add login fields and error message to GUI

Making a major change that should be reviewed by someone:
    VCS -> Commit
    VCS -> Create Pull Request
    Once the pull request is created, assign reviewers

When you want to push your changes to master on GitHub:
    VCS -> Commit
    VCS -> Git -> Fetch
    On the bottom-right of the window:
        Git
        Remote Branches: origin/master -> Merge
    VCS -> Git -> Push
